## About this Site

The link above is to the materials for the six-week MBA course I taught in Spring 2025.  The course is certainly not perfect.  It was developed "just in time" and substantially redesigned on the fly.  Nevertheless, it seemed to work reasonably well, so I offer it as a possible starting point for people who may want to teach this topic but have not yet done so.  If you have experience teaching it or have other things to add, please let us know in the comments below.

We all face a difficult job keeping up in this rapidly evolving environment.  I hope this site can make that somewhat easier.  I would be happy to host guest bloggers or to link content from others to make this a shared resource.  Post a comment below to share your views.
