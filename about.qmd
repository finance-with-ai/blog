My goal for this site is to communicate things I've learned about teaching MBA students at Rice University how to do financial analyses with "AI + coding" and more broadly how generative AI can and is being used in the finance industry.  The site is intended to be a resource for finance instructors at the undergraduate, MBA, and MSF levels.  

The current effectiveness of AI + coding varies somewhat between corporate finance and investments applications.  Here, I lump fundamental security analysis in with corporate finance, due to its similarity to capital budgeting.  There are many topics in investments for which spreadsheet programs were never well equipped and for which spreadsheet programs are seldom used in practice.  Previously, it was difficult to teach those topics by example, but now students can prompt an LLM to generate code for them.

Even in capital budgeting, financial analysis, and pro forma financial valuation, AI is already very valuable.  It is not ready to replace spreadsheets, but it can be a useful complement to spreadsheets.  AI can be used as a collaborator -- "tell me how you would do this" or "you do it your way, and I'll do it my way, and then we can compare answers."  As the models improve, I expect the world to shift more and more to AI in lieu of spreadsheets even for these corporate finance applications.  Of course, Hewlett-Packard is still making the 12C financial calculator, and Microsoft will undoubtedly sell Excel for many years to come, but I think AI + coding will eventually be dominant.  To prepare our students for this world, we should start teaching them now about what is likely to lie ahead.


We all face a difficult job keeping up in this rapidly evolving environment.  I hope this site can make that somewhat easier.  I would be happy to host guest bloggers or to link content from others to make this a shared resource.
