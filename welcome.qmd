## About this Blog

My goal for this site is to communicate things I've learned about teaching MBA students at Rice University how to do financial analyses using "AI + coding" and more broadly how generative AI can and is being used in the finance industry.  I am posting short notes on what I've learned about teaching this topic.  The site is intended to be a resource for finance instructors at the undergraduate, MBA, and MSF levels. The link above is to the materials for the six-week MBA course I taught in Spring 2025.  The course is certainly not perfect.  It was developed "just in time" and substantially redesigned on the fly.  Nevertheless, it seemed to work reasonably well, so I offer it as a possible starting point for people who may want to teach this topic but have not yet done so.  If you have experience teaching it, please let us know in the comments below.

The current effectiveness of AI + coding varies somewhat between corporate finance and investments applications.  Here, I lump fundamental security analysis with corporate finance.  There are many topics in the investments area for which spreadsheets were never well equipped and for which spreadsheets are seldom used in practice.  Previously, it was difficult to teach those topics by example, but now students can prompt an LLM to generate code for them.

Even in capital budgeting, financial statement analysis, and pro forma financial valuation, AI is already very valuable.  It is not yet ready to replace spreadsheets, but it can be a useful complement to spreadsheets.  AI can be used as a collaborator -- "tell me how you would do this" or "you do it your way, and I'll do it my way, and then we can compare answers."  As the models improve, I expect the world to shift more and more to AI in lieu of spreadsheets even for corporate finance applications.  Of course, Hewlett-Packard is still making the 12C financial calculator, and Microsoft will undoubtedly sell Excel for many years to come, but I think AI + coding will eventually dominate.  To prepare our students for that world, we should start teaching them now about what is likely to lie ahead.

We all face a difficult job keeping up in this rapidly evolving environment.  I hope this site can make that somewhat easier.  I would be happy to host guest bloggers or to link content from others to make this a shared resource.  Post a comment below to share your views.
