    "text": "The world is aware that generative AI has made coders more efficient, but I’m not sure there is as much recognition of the arguably more important fact that gen AI has made coding accessible to non-coders. I expect this to change rapidly by word of mouth (can we still call it that in this era of social media?). Once exposed to the wonder of coding with gen AI, one cannot help but want to share the word."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mean-variance optimization is one of those topics that was always awkward to teach with spreadsheets. It is clunky to define the portfolio variance in a spreadsheet for more than two assets, and we are forced to use Solver to find efficient portfolios or to deal with the further clunkiness of matrix inversion in a spreadsheet. Also, if we create an example for three assets and someone asks about four, then we have to almost entirely reengineer the spreadsheet. Luckily, the leading models have been trained on enough mean-variance material to know the formula \\(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu\\) and to correctly implement it each time. For these reasons, mean-variance optimization provides a very nice example to demonstrate the power of AI + python.\nIf we want to implement constraints or to find the efficient frontier without a risk-free asset, then there are alternate routes the models may take, so it pays to be familiar with those before launching into live demos in class."

    "text": "My goal for this site is to communicate things I’ve learned about teaching MBA students at Rice University how to do financial analyses with “AI + coding” and more broadly how generative AI can and is being used in the finance industry. It is intended to be a resource for finance instructors at the undergraduate, MBA, and MSF levels.\nMy view is that we are at the beginning of a transition from spreadsheet programs to AI + coding that will be very similar to the transition from financial calculators to spreadsheet programs. Already, AI + coding is a better tool for many things that we now teach using spreadsheets, and I believe the improvement in large language models (LLMs) and the proliferation of tools for applying them will eventually result in the near-obsolescence of spreadsheets, much as financial calculators are effectively obsolete now. To prepare our students for this world, we should start teaching them now about what is likely to lie ahead.\nWe all face a difficult job keeping up in this rapidly evolving environment. Hopefully, this site will make that job easier. I would be happy to host guest bloggers or to link content from others to make this a shared resource."
