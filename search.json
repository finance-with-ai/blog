    "text": "Grabbing and visualizing online data is a good place to start to demonstrate to students the power and simplicity of AI + python. Yahoo Finance is a good source of free online data about stock and option prices and corporate financial statements. The yfinance library is the best python library for retrieving it. FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) is a great source for macroeconomic data, including Treasury and corporate bond yields, crude oil prices, etc. The pandas-datareader library is the best python library for accessing FRED. Neither yfinance nor pandas-datareader requires you to obtain an API key.\nComputing stock returns with yfinance is a good starting point. Yahoo Finance computes dividend and split adjusted closing prices. We can compute total close-to-close returns, including dividend returns, as percent changes of the adjusted closing prices.1 The yfinance library recently changed to returning the adjusted prices by default rather than returning standard (split-adjusted) prices. The confusing part is that it now calls the adjusted prices returned by default “Close” rather than the former “Adj Close.” I recommend prompting the LLM to use the latest version of yfinance and explicitly prompting the LLM to get the “Close” instead of “Adj Close.”\nA more complex but also more transparent solution to the Close/Adj Close confusion is to prompt the LLM to use the yfinance download function with auto_adjust set to False (this was the old behavior) and to get both the “Close” and “Adj Close.” Percent changes in “Adj Close” are what you want for returns. To show students the difference between the two, you could ask for percent changes in both and then filter to dates where the percent changes differ by more than 0.00001 or so. Those dates will be the ex-dividend days. The difference between the two percent changes on those days is the quarterly dividend yield.\nThe Yahoo Finance data starts in 1970. To get the longest possible history for a ticker, you can ask it to start in 1970. You can specify other dates and you can specify the frequency of the data - daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual. After computing returns, students can go immediately to creating charts. Python has very versatile plotting libraries. The LLM will default to matplotlib or seaborn, depending on what type of chart you ask for. You can ask Julius to adjust the figure size, font sizes, tick locations, tick labels, axis labels, title, legend positioning, and more. Figures can be saved and downloaded as jpegs, pngs, pdfs, or other types. Different themes can also be applied – gridded or not gridded, light or dark background, etc. Rather than attempting to teach all of these possibilities, I recommend encouraging students to ask Julius what is possible. They should get in the habit of turning to AI for advice, collaboration, and assistance in whatever task they are doing.\nAfter exploring stock returns with yfinance, I turn to exploring FRED data using pandas-datareader. Students can start by going to the FRED website and using point-and-click to find data and download it as csv files. Then, they can turn to Julius to do the same thing more quickly. For example, “get me the history of 10-year Treasury yields from FRED using pandas-datareader at a daily frequency and plot them.” There are alternate ways of getting the FRED data: there are other FRED-specific python libraries and there is the generic requests library. But pandas-datareader provides the easiest access. In subsequent posts, we’ll explore Ken French’s data library, the SEC EDGAR site, and scraping data from websites using the requests and beautiful soup libraries.\nFirst published on finance-with-ai.org"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThere is a slight caveat that the percent change of the adjusted closing price on an ex-dividend day takes the dividend out of the denominator of the price ratio rather than adding it to the numerator, but, given typical quarterly dividend yields, the difference between these numbers is slight. Percent changes of adjusted closing prices on all days other than ex-dividend days equal percent changes in split-adjusted closing prices.↩︎"

    "text": "The purpose of this blog and the site finance-with-ai.org is to communicate things I’ve learned about teaching MBA students at Rice University how to do financial analyses using “AI + coding” and more broadly how generative AI can and is being used in the finance industry. I will post short notes on what I’ve learned about teaching this topic and on related things I find interesting. The blog is intended to be a resource for finance instructors at the undergraduate, MBA, and MSF levels.\nThe current effectiveness of AI + coding varies somewhat between corporate finance and investments applications. Here, I lump fundamental security analysis with corporate finance. There are many topics in the investments area for which spreadsheets were never well equipped and for which spreadsheets are seldom used in practice. Previously, it was difficult to teach those topics by example, but now students can prompt an LLM to generate code for them.\nEven in capital budgeting, financial statement analysis, and pro forma financial valuation, AI is already very valuable. It is not yet ready to replace spreadsheets, but it can be a useful complement to spreadsheets. AI can be used as a collaborator – “tell me how you would do this” or “you do it your way, and I’ll do it my way, and then we can compare answers.” As the models improve, I expect the world to shift more and more to AI in lieu of spreadsheets even for corporate finance applications. Of course, Hewlett-Packard is still making the 12C financial calculator, and Microsoft will undoubtedly sell Excel for many years to come, but I think AI + coding will eventually dominate. To prepare our students for that world, we should start teaching them now about what is likely to lie ahead.\n\nFirst published on finance-with-ai.org"

    "title": "Julius and the Democratization of Coding",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The world is aware that generative AI has made coders more efficient, but I don’t know if there is as much recognition of the more important fact that gen AI has made coding accessible to non-coders. I expect this to change rapidly by word of mouth: Once exposed to the wonder of coding with gen AI, one cannot help but want to share the word. We can accelerate that change for our students.\nThere are many IDEs (integrated development environements) that incorporate AI assistance, among which Cursor may be the most popular at the moment. Those tools are fantastic, but the variety of options makes them intimidating to non-coders. The leading chatbots also have “code interpreters” that execute generated code to respond to prompts. But, as of this writing, those interpreters are closed systems. They provide a fixed menu of libraries and do not allow the user to install more. Julius.ai bridges the gap. It is a full-fledged coding environment, allowing the user to install any library he or she wishes. At the same time, it has the ease of use of a chatbot (and get the 50% academic discount by emailing team@julius.ai from your university email for the promo code).\nThe Julius website states that it provides an “intuitive way to analyze and visualize data without having to code, making statistical analysis accessible to everyone.” Democratizing coding is the goal of the Julius developers. However, the focus on statistical analysis understates what Julius has to offer. You can choose to work in either python or R. If you choose python, which I recommend, then you can do anything with Julius that python can do, and python can do pretty much everything. We’ll explore lots of applications in subsequent posts. I’ll refer to Julius throughout my posts, because that is what I use in my course, but the things we discuss will generally apply to other AI + python setups as well.\nJulius is a wrapper around large language models (LLMs), including the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic as of this writing. Julius sends the user’s prompts to the user’s selected LLM (the general consensus in the blogosphere, and my own impression, is that the Anthropic models Claude 3.5 and Claude 3.7 are the best coders available at this time) with additional context created by the Julius developers. If the LLM generates code, then Julius’s servers execute it. The user can see the code as it is written and see what the code creates. The chat is very informative, telling the user what the plan is before the code is generated and then interpreting and explaining the results afterwards. A benefit of this process is that students learn something about coding in a relatively painless way.\nA valid concern about gen AI coding for non-coders is that an LLM may make a mistake that the user cannot detect. When OpenAI released GPT 3.5 in 2022, it frequently hallucinated. It is natural to worry about hallucinations in AI-generated code. One saving grace is that the models have improved tremendously since 2022, and hallucinations are much less common. An equally important consideration is the nature of coding. Hallucinations about facts in coding would be hallucinations about syntax, and incorrect syntax won’t run. Syntax errors certainly happen, but Julius sends the error messages back to the LLM in an iterative manner until, almost always, the syntax is corrected and the code runs. The type of error that usually happens with gen AI coding for non-coders results from the LLM not fully understanding what the user wants. To guard against this, it is important to be explicit in prompts. It is also important to engage in a two-way conversation with the LLM about what you want, what it understands regarding what you want, what it plans to do, and what it did.\nThere are competing products that are certainly worth showing to students, and new products are appearing at a rapid pace. Plus, the leading LLM providers are expanding their services. An example of a competing product is Vizly. It has the same data analysis/visualization focus as Julius. The developers were previously at Plotly, and the default plotting library is plotly, which creates very nice interactive HTML plots (you can also use plotly with Julius). Vizly is worth exploring, but I don’t have a lot of experience with it. Casting the net wider, students should be introduced to Google Colab. It is not a chatbot, but it is a free JupyterLab environment with free AI assistance provided by the latest Google model (Gemini 2.5 as of this writing). You start by opening a new notebook or exploring the provided Introduction to Colab notebook. I recommend starting a notebook by asking the AI to mount your Google Drive. Then you can read and write files from your Google Drive (ask the AI to do that also). You can also save your Jupyter notebook there. Casting the net even wider, I highly recommend Replit. It creates very professional web apps, writing the HTML and CSS to create the user interface along with (usually) python to do the actual work. It also provides a hosting service, so you can deploy your app online with just a few clicks. We’ll explore creating apps with Julius in subsequent posts using the python streamlit and gradio libraries.\nThere are many more AI + coding tools out there.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Calculating betas is another easy exercise to do with Julius. We can also calculate the market risk premium, and we can get the risk-free rate (from FRED), so we can estimate the cost of equity capital according to the CAPM. This exercise provides the opportunity to explore Ken French’s data library in the process of getting market excess returns.\nA big advantage of using AI is that things can be automated. A student this spring told me that a friend of his in the finance industry had just used AI to reduce the time required for a certain task he often had to do from two days to two hours. There are many stories like that. To illustrate automation in a simple setting, I use the CAPM calculation to show how PowerPoint decks can be created with AI + python. In a future post, I will explain how to use AI + python to build a web app that estimates a beta, calculates the cost of equity, and generates a PowerPoint deck - the user only has to input a ticker. And, the builder of the app only has to chat with Julius.\nTo estimate betas, we need stock excess returns and market excess returns. I follow the usual academic convention of monthly returns over a 5-year period. To get monthly stock returns we can use yfinance (see Online Data and Visualization). To get adjusted closing prices at a monthly frequency, simply ask Julius for them (the LLM will either use period=“1mo” in yf.download or it will use the pandas resample method to downsample daily prices to monthly prices). Ask for a bit more than five years, because we may lose some months when merging with the market data. Then compute returns as percent changes.\nTo get market excess returns and the risk-free rate, we can use Ken French’s data library. It’s interesting to start by asking Julius to list the datasets available in French’s data library. Then ask Julius to get the monthly three factors using pandas-datareader starting in 1926 and to compute the mean of Mkt-RF for the market risk premium estimate. If you don’t explicitly ask for pandas-datareader to be used, it may try to directly read the csv files on French’s website into pandas dataframes, which doesn’t work well, because each file contains text and contains multiple tables (monthly, annual, etc.).\nTo estimate betas, we want to first do an inner merge of the Fama-French data with the stock return data. There are two issues. First, the stock return data will be in decimals and the Fama-French data is in percents. Julius may or may not notice that, so it is good to explicitly ask to convert the stock returns to percents or the Fama-French data to decimals (take your choice). The second issue is that the dates will be in different formats. Pandas-datareader will return the Fama-French dates in what is called the pandas period format, whereas the stock return format will be in the pandas timestamp format. Julius will figure this out, but it may speed up the merge to warn it that the date formats will need to be reconciled. Once the data is merged, keep the last 60 months for which there are no missing data, calculate excess stock returns by subtracting RF (which is in the Fama-French three factor dataset), and then ask Julius to run the regression.\nOnce the beta is estimated, the final step is to get the current risk-free rate. I ask Julius to get the latest value of the three-month T-bill yield from FRED, but it can get different rates if you prefer something else. At this point, you can just ask Julius to compute the cost of equity. The LLMs know the CAPM formula.\nPowerPoint decks can be created in python with the py-pptx library. The details are not important, because the LLMs know them. I like to ask Julius to create a PowerPoint deck with two slides, the first being a scatterplot representing the regression, and the second being a table showing the cost of equity calculation. Usually, it delivers a nice looking deck without any further prompting, but you may want to fine tune it in an iterative way. It will use the seaborn regplot function to produce the scatterplot with the regression line. Sometimes it will show a confidence interval band around the regression line representing the standard error in the beta estimate. When this happens, I ask Julius to remove it, but you may have a different preference.\nIf you try this, let us know how it goes in the comments below.\n\nFirst published on finance-with-ai.org"
