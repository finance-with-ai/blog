    "text": "In this post, I’ll demonstrate how to create an interactive Streamlit application that performs mean-variance portfolio optimization using Julia. This tool is perfect for teaching modern portfolio theory in investment courses, allowing students to visualize the efficient frontier and experiment with different portfolio constraints.\nWe’ll cover: - Setting up Julia and Streamlit - Implementing the mean-variance optimization algorithm - Creating an interactive user interface - Visualizing the efficient frontier - Adding constraints and risk-free assets\nThis application will help students: - Understand the relationship between risk and return - Visualize portfolio diversification benefits - Experiment with different asset combinations - See how constraints affect optimal portfolios\nStay tuned for the complete tutorial where we’ll build this educational tool step by step!"
