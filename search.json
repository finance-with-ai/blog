    "text": "My goal here is to communicate things I’ve learned about teaching MBA students at Rice University about how to do financial analyses with “AI + coding” and more broadly how generative AI can and is being used in the finance industry. It is intended to be a resource for finance instructors at the undergraduate, MBA, and MSF levels.\nMy view is that we at the beginning of a transition from spreadsheet programs to AI + coding that will be very similar to the transition from financial calculators to spreadsheet programs. Already, AI + coding is a better tool for many things that we now teach using spreadsheets, and I believe the improvement in large language models (LLMs) and the proliferation of tools for applying them will eventually result in the near-obsolescence of spreadsheets. We all face a difficult job in keeping up with this rapidly evolving environment. Hopefully, this site will provide some assistance. I would be happy to host “guest bloggers” or to link content from others to make this a shared resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Mean-Variance Optimization App with Streamlit and Julia\n\n\n\nJulia\n\nPortfolio Optimization\n\nStreamlit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 14, 2024\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "In this post, I’ll demonstrate how to create an interactive Streamlit application that performs mean-variance portfolio optimization using Julia. This tool is perfect for teaching modern portfolio theory in investment courses, allowing students to visualize the efficient frontier and experiment with different portfolio constraints.\nWe’ll cover: - Setting up Julia and Streamlit - Implementing the mean-variance optimization algorithm - Creating an interactive user interface - Visualizing the efficient frontier - Adding constraints and risk-free assets\nThis application will help students: - Understand the relationship between risk and return - Visualize portfolio diversification benefits - Experiment with different asset combinations - See how constraints affect optimal portfolios\nStay tuned for the complete tutorial where we’ll build this educational tool step by step!"
