Calculating betas is another easy exercise to do with Julius.  We can also calculate the market risk premium, and we can get the risk-free rate (from FRED), so we can estimate the cost of equity capital according to the CAPM.  This exercise provides the opportunity to explore Ken French's data library in the process of getting market excess returns.

A big advantage of using AI is that things can be automated.  A student this spring told me that a friend of his in the finance industry had just used AI to reduce the time required for a certain task he often had to do from two days to two hours.  There are many stories like that.  To illustrate automation in a simple setting, I use the CAPM calculation to show how PowerPoint decks can be created with AI + python.  In a future post, I will explain how to use AI + python to build a web app that estimates a beta, calculates the cost of equity, and generates a PowerPoint deck - the user only has to input a ticker.  And, the builder of the app only has to chat with Julius.
