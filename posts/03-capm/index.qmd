Calculating betas is another easy exercise to do with Julius.  We can also calculate the market risk premium, and we can get the risk-free rate (from FRED), so we can estimate the cost of equity capital according to the CAPM.  This exercise provides the opportunity to explore Ken French's data library in the process of getting market excess returns.

A big advantage of using AI is that things can be automated.  A student this spring told me that a friend of his in the finance industry had just used AI to reduce the time required for a certain task he often had to do from two days to two hours.  There are many stories like that.  To illustrate automation in a simple setting, I use the CAPM calculation to show how PowerPoint decks can be created with AI + python.  In a future post, I will explain how to use AI + python to build a web app that estimates a beta, calculates the cost of equity, and generates a PowerPoint deck - the user only has to input a ticker.  And, the builder of the app only has to chat with Julius.

To estimate betas, we need stock excess returns and market excess returns.  I follow the usual academic convention of monthly returns over a 5-year period.  To get monthly stock returns we can use yfinance (see [Online Data and Visualization](https://finance-with-ai.org/posts/02-online-data/)).  To get adjusted closing prices at a monthly frequency, simply ask Julius for them (the LLM will either use period="1mo" in yf.download or it will use the pandas resample method to downsample daily prices to monthly prices).  Ask for a bit more than five years, because we may lose some months when merging with the market data.

To get market excess returns and the risk-free rate, we can use Ken French's [data library](]
