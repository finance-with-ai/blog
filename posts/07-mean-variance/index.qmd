Mean-variance optimization is one of those topics that was always awkward to teach with spreadsheets.  It is clunky to define the portfolio variance in a spreadsheet for more than two assets, and we are forced to use Solver to find efficient portfolios or to deal with the further clunkiness of matrix inversion in a spreadsheet.    Also, if we create an example for three assets and someone asks about four, then we have to almost entirely reengineer the spreadsheet.  I don't think we actually expect students to ever do mean-variance analysis in a spreadsheet after they graduate - we're just teaching the concept (I think).  But, we can now teach the concept with a more professional tool rather than a purely educational device.

why not teach the conceptcould we teach the concept better if we had a system that could take in different data, including different numbers of assets, and Of course, Luckily, the leading models have been trained on enough mean-variance material to know  the formula $\Sigma^{-1}\mu$ and to correctly implement it each time.  For these reasons, mean-variance optimization provides a very nice example to demonstrate the power of AI + python.

If we want to implement constraints or to find the efficient frontier without a risk-free asset, then there are alternate routes the models may take, so it pays to be familiar with those before launching into live demos in class.
