The world is aware that generative AI has made coders more efficient, but I don't know if there is as much recognition of the more important fact that gen AI has made coding accessible to non-coders. I expect this to change rapidly by word of mouth: Once exposed to the wonder of coding with gen AI, one cannot help but want to share the word.  We can accelerate that change for our students.

There are many tools to assist coders with coding, among which [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) may be the most popular at the moment.  The leading chatbots also have "code interpreters" that execute generated code to respond to prompts.  But, as of this writing, those interpreters are closed systems.  They provide a fixed menu of libraries and do not allow the user to install more.  [Julius.ai](https://julius.ai) bridges the gap.  It is a full-fledged coding environment, allowing the user to install any library he or she wishes.  At the same time, it has the ease of use of a chatbot.  Also, there is a 50% academic discount available (email team@julius.ai from your university email account and ask for the promo code).

The Julius website states that it provides an "intuitive way to analyze and visualize data without having to code, making statistical analysis accessible to everyone."  Democratizing coding is the  goal of the Julius developers.  However, the focus on statistical analysis understates what Julius has to offer.  You can choose to work in either python or R.  If you choose python, which I recommend, then you can do anything with Julius that python can do, and python can do pretty much everything.  We'll explore lots of applications in subsequent posts.

Julius is a wrapper around large language models (LLMs), including the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic as of this writing.  It sends the user's prompts to the user's selected LLM with additional context created by the Julius team.  If the LLM generates code, Julius's servers execute it.   The user can see the code as it is written and see what the code creates.  A benefit of this process is that students learn something about coding in a relatively painless way.  The user can also chat with the LLMs one does with chatbots in general, which is an important part of the overall process.

A valid concern about gen AI coding for non-coders is that an LLM may make a mistake that the user cannot detect.  When OpenAI released GPT 3.5 in 2022, it frequently hallucinated.  It is natural to worry about hallucination with AI-generated code.  One saving grace is that the models have improved tremendously since 2022, and hallucinations are much less common.   An equally important consideration is the nature of coding.  Hallucinations about facts in coding would be hallucinations about syntax, and incorrect syntax won't run.  Syntax errors certainly happen, but Julius sends the error messages back to the LLM in an iterative manner until, almost always, the syntax is corrected and the program runs.  The type of error that usually happens with gen AI coding for non-coders results from the LLM not fully understanding what the user wants.  To guard against this, it is important to be explicit in prompts.  It is also important to engage in a two-way conversation with the LLM about what you want, what it understands regarding what you want, what it plans to do, and what it did.  

There are competing products that are certainly worth showing to students, and new products are appearing at a rapid pace.  Plus, the leading LLM providers are expanding their services.  An example of a competing product is [Vizly](https://vizly.fyi/).  It has the same data analysis/visualization focus as Julius.  The developers were previously at Plotly, and the default plotting library is plotly, which creates very nice interactive HTML plots (you can also use plotly with Julius).  Vizly is worth exploring, but I don't have a lot of experience with it.  Casting the net wider, students should be introduced to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  It is not a chatbot, but it is a free JupyterLab environment with free AI assistance provided by the latest Google model (Gemini 2.5 as of this writing).  You start by opening a new notebook or exploring the introduction to Colab notebook.  I recommend starting a notebook by asking the AI to mount your Google Drive.  Then you can read and write files from your Google Drive (ask the AI to do that also).  You can also save your Jupyter notebook there.  Casting the net even wider, I highly recommend [Replit](https://replit.com/~).  It creates very professional web apps, writing the HTML and CSS to create the user interface along with (usually) python to do the actual work.  It also provides a hosting service, so you can deploy your app online with just a few clicks.  We'll explore creating apps with Julius in subsequent posts using the streamlit and gradio libraries in python.
